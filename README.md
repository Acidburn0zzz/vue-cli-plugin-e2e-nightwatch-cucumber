# vue-cli-plugin-e2e-nightwatch-cucumber

> Nightwatch/Cucumber plugin for Vue CLI 3

## Injected Commands

```sh
vue-cli-service test:e2e
```

## Configuration

The plugin will generate exemplary feature files and step definitions. Everything is pre-configured for you, you just have to run the `vue-cli-service test:e2e` command. 

You can edit `nightwatch.config.js` in your project root, but remember that the plugin is still in itâ€™s infancy and many configuration options lead to unexcepted results. Cucumber configuration is also planned, but not yet implemented.

## Installing

``` sh
vue add e2e-nightwatch-cucumber
```
